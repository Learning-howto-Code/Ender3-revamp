# Ender3-revamp
My Ender 3 is feeling quite outdated, epsecalily with everyone having an A1 mini these days. A lot of the feautres my printer are missinga re quite simple though, so I decided to make opensource versions of them. 
## The revamp
- LED task light to light up my printbed
- LED neopixel print progress bar(Like the H2D)
- Octorpint running on a raspberry pi
- A Cameera Module 2 for time-alapses and locally running print failure detection

  ## CAD
For the CAD I made an enlcosure for both of the LED sirps, with a 3d printed diffuser, and an enclsoure for the Raspberry pi, camera and a spot to hide the wires. The pink assembly will mount on the top of the 8020 extrusion like the filamnet spool holder, and the green assembly will mount to the back side of the same extrusion(shown as a blue box for reference.)
